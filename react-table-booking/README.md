Let's create a simple challenge using reactjs

Table booking app is used for booking a table in a restaurant

First, there should be tables displayed in the page. Each table represents the actual table in restaurant.

Next, Used can select any table and a form will be displayed.

After that fill the details and click the button to reserve the table. And you will get an alert message by that.

Finally you will see a text "Table Reserved" on the table that you selected.
